# test_task_details
## *Prerequisites*
Please, install necessary python packages using *pip install -r requirements.txt*
## *Run*
To test the algorithm use command prompt *python3 run.py --imgs-path <path_to_images_folder>*  
## *Description*
The algorithm doesn't utilize any neural network because it's simpler,more robust and far more faster to use just OpenCV toolkit rather then utilizing a neural network in this specific task case 
## *Colab notebook*
